I have a legacy to fulfill which I started last year so the goddamn post is gonna be real long one…..Tai lyaad kheye…. Ghumiye niye sob kaj serei Porte bosh is Karon onk time lagbe🤣🤣🤣 <br />
This post is not gonna be short…..I repeat this one is gonna be real long one….😌😌🔥🔥 <br />
You Know right how excited I was for this day, maybe more than you.  <br />
Years have added up to our friendship which has faced the various ups and downs of life.  <br />
Still it seems like yesterday. <br />
Who knew Quarrels, Fights, Teasing and Leg Pulling will bring out the best in us ? <br />
<br />
To the girl who knows the meaning of Friendship more than anyone I believe <br />
To the girl who never leaves a single occasion to fight with me.  <br />
To the girl who has evolved into a woman(into a child). <br />
To the girl who  black mails me emotionally always. <br />
To the girl who always listen to my tantrums <br />
To the girl who never calls me nowadays 😭 <br />
To the girl who always scolds me for my bad habits. <br /> 
To the girl who always(not always) gets my jokes. <br />
To the girl with whom I can be my true self. <br />
To the girl with whom I share a friendship goa(just makkhan for bhalo jaygay treat). <br />
To the girl who means a lot to me(fucking yes). <br />
To the girl who will gift me an Iphone🤣🤣🤣 <br />
<br />
From sharing comfortable silence to never-ending overnight calls <br />
from sharing something absolutely nonsense and have that nonsense respected <br />
from annoying each other to being each other's therapists <br />
from laughing like a seal to crying on each other's shoulders <br />
<br />
Sorry for being suuuucccccchhhhhh an annoying person. I guess there hasn’t been a day when I haven’t annoyed you 😂.Besh korechi . But even after annoying you and fighting over small things, I am lucky that you haven’t bombed me yet. Enough of comedy, now lets do a throwback.  <br />
 First e sei  olpo kotha hoto(sotti olpo kotha hoto amdr eksomay...bhaba jay). Then arektu beshi. And now tor matha khai 24*7. Well this year was full of memories, only good this time luckily 🤣. Good times which which we cherished and bad times which tested our bond. Even though we overcame the bad times kintu bapre baap, majhe majhe matha kaj kortona oi time guloye(akhon o kore na). You know what all things I did tai ar ekhane bolchina. You have guided me in every decision that I have taken, helped me in every situation, calmed me whenever I lost my cool, scolded me whenever I was wrong and helped me become a better human being by telling me my goods and bads. Yes, I have broken many promises. I have picked up many fights. I have given you bad memories. There’ve been massive arguments. There’ve been times we didn’t talk. There’ve been dark moments, from smile to tears, from happiness to strife. Yet, through this chaos you have always stood strong backing me all the time even when you know I was wrong. You are more than just a friend for me. You are a part of my family. Wishing you a very happy birthday once again Baccha❤ <br />
 <br />
I had soo much more to say, but as usual I couldn’t condense it into a single posar likhle next year ki likhbo. <br />
Whenever I screw up, you always stick around and whenever I need you, you lend a helping hand. You know exactly what to say and what I need to feel better. Meeting you and learning the true meaning of friendship with you is one of the highlights of my life. Happy birthday to the girl who knows me the best, and all the good and bad! <br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Birthday kiddo. ❤️ <br />
May God bless you with all the happiness in life and you achieve all success 🙏🏼 <br />
Stay Like Always. <br />
Keep Smiling, Stay Happy.  <br />
The 69 day long countdown ends today😝 <br />
🎉😊😊❤️😘😊 <br />
 <br />
  <br />
  P.S - I  am always there for you. 😌 <br />
   <br />
P.S.S. - You can have infinite number of boyfriends, half boyfriends,quarter boyfriends,bor,husband,just friends,friends with benefits…..but you can have only one beast friend that will always be me.
